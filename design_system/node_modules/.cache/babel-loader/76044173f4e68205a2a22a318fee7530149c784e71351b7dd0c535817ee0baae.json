It is characterized by a decrease in GDP, rising unemployment rates, reduced consumer spending, and declining business profits. Recessionary periods are challenging times for individuals, businesses, and governments alike, with widespread implications for various aspects of society. The impact of a recession is felt across multiple sectors of the economy. Unemployment rates rise as businesses downsize or close altogether, leading to financial hardships for many families. Consumer spending decreases as people become more cautious about their finances, which further dampens economic growth. Additionally, businesses face challenges such as declining revenues, reduced access to credit, and increased uncertainty about future market conditions.Several factors can contribute to the onset of a recession. These include financial crises, such as banking failures or stock market crashes, which can trigger a domino effect of economic downturn. External shocks, such as natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, can also disrupt economic activity and lead to recessionary conditions. Moreover, structural imbalances in the economy, such as excessive debt levels or overinvestment in certain industries, can exacerbate economic downturns. Recovery from a recession is often slow and gradual. Governments and central banks typically implement monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate economic growth and stabilize financial markets. These may include lowering interest rates, increasing government spending on infrastructure projects, and providing financial assistance to struggling industries. However, the effectiveness of these measures can vary depending on the severity and duration of the recession, as well as broader global economic conditions.In recent history, the world has experienced several notable recessions, including the Great Recession of 2008-2009, triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. This recession had far-reaching consequences, including widespread job losses, home foreclosures, and a global economic downturn. The recovery from the Great Recession was slow and uneven, highlighting the challenges of navigating through recessions in an interconnected global economy.In conclusion, recessions are inevitable parts of the economic cycle, characterized by periods of contraction and hardship followed by eventual recovery. While the impact of recessions can be severe, proactive measures by governments, businesses, and individuals can help mitigate their effects and pave the way for a return to economic stability and growth.\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 48,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 47,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 43,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 11,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n_c = PresentationLayer;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"PresentationLayer\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","Box","TextField","DataGrid","rows","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","PresentationLayer","sx","padding","children","display","id","label","fullWidth","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","marginLeft","justifyContent","marginTop","style","borderRadius","columns","field","headerName","width","checkboxSelection","className","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/home/raj/RAJ/SOFTWORTH/INTERN WORK/DESIGN_SYSTEM/DESIGN_SYSTEM/design_system/src/Components/ShopsPage.tsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Box from '@mui/material/Box';\nimport TextField from '@mui/material/TextField';\nimport { DataGrid } from '@mui/x-data-grid';\nimport { rows } from './MockData';\nimport '../Css/ShopsPage.css'\n\nexport default function PresentationLayer() {\n\n  return (\n    <Box sx={{ padding: '20px' }}>\n      <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', padding: '10px' }}>\n        <TextField\n          id=\"searchShop\"\n          label=\"Search for shop\"\n          fullWidth\n        ></TextField>\n        <TextField\n          id=\"searchInventory\"\n          label=\"Select for inventory\"\n          fullWidth\n          sx={{ marginLeft: '10px' }}\n        ></TextField>\n      </Box>\n\n      <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginTop: '30px' }}>\n        <button style={{ padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '7px' }}>search</button>\n      </Box>\n\n\n      <Box sx={{ marginTop: '30px' }}>\n        <DataGrid\n          rows={rows}\n          columns={[\n            { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 500 },\n            { field: 'shop', headerName: 'Shop', width: 500 },\n            { field: 'inventory', headerName: 'Inventory', width: 500 },\n            { field: 'products', headerName: 'Products', width: 500 }\n          ]}\n          checkboxSelection\n        ></DataGrid>\n      </Box>\n      <div className='container'>\n        <div className='title'>\n          <h3>Understanding Recession: Impact, Causes, and Recovery</h3>\n        </div>\n        <div className='body'>\n          <p>\n          A recession is a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for an extended period, typically measured in months or even years. \n          It is characterized by a decrease in GDP, rising unemployment rates, reduced consumer spending, and declining business profits.
